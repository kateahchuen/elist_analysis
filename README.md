# Elist E-Commerce Post-Pandemic Analysis

## Executive Summary
Elist is a global e-commerce giant specializing in popular electronic products. In this project, I collaborated with Angie, Head of Operations, to support cross-functional teams including Finance, Sales, Product, and Marketing by providing data-driven insights into Elist’s performance during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The primary goal of this analysis is to help stakeholders make informed decisions that will enhance operational efficiency and elevate the customer experience in the post-pandemic landscape. Using Elist's dataset, I identified key trends and growth metrics related to revenue, average order value (AOV), product popularity, marketing channel effectiveness, refund rates, and operational efficiency. Additionally, I conducted a focused analysis of Elist’s recently launched loyalty program, evaluating its impact on overall sales, AOV, and order volume.

This project contributes to Elist’s ongoing strategy to deliver world-class products and experiences to customers worldwide through insight-driven decision-making.
